# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document specifies the requirements for a server-side Minecraft mod that enables players to upload custom audio files to music discs via a command, play them through Simple Voice Chat integration, and provides an API for addon developers to intercept audio playback.

## Glossary

- **Player**: A user connected to the Minecraft server
- **Music Disc**: A Minecraft item that can play audio when inserted into a jukebox
- **Audio File**: A sound file in a supported format (e.g., MP3, OGG, WAV)
- **Simple Voice Chat**: A third-party mod that provides voice communication and audio streaming capabilities
- **Audio API**: The programming interface that allows addon mods to intercept and modify audio playback
- **Upload Command**: The `/audiodisc upload` command used to load audio from a URL
- **Held Item**: The item currently selected in the player's hotbar
- **Jukebox**: A Minecraft block that plays music discs

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a server administrator, I want players to be able to upload custom audio to music discs, so that they can personalize their gameplay experience with custom music.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Player executes the `/audiodisc upload` command with a valid URL, THE AudioDisc System SHALL download the Audio File from the provided URL
2. WHEN the Audio File download completes successfully, THE AudioDisc System SHALL validate that the file format is supported
3. IF the Audio File format is not natively supported but can be converted, THE AudioDisc System SHALL automatically install FFmpeg and convert the file to a supported format
4. IF the Player does not hold a Music Disc as their Held Item, THEN THE AudioDisc System SHALL display an error message to the Player
5. WHEN the Audio File is validated or converted successfully, THE AudioDisc System SHALL associate the audio data with the Music Disc in the Player's hand
6. WHEN the audio association is complete, THE AudioDisc System SHALL display a success message to the Player

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a player, I want my custom audio disc to play through Simple Voice Chat when placed in a jukebox, so that other players can hear my custom music.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a custom Music Disc is inserted into a Jukebox, THE AudioDisc System SHALL retrieve the associated Audio File data
2. WHEN the Audio File data is retrieved, THE AudioDisc System SHALL stream the audio through the Simple Voice Chat integration
3. WHILE the custom Music Disc is playing, THE AudioDisc System SHALL maintain synchronization between all players within hearing range
4. WHEN a Player removes the Music Disc from the Jukebox, THE AudioDisc System SHALL stop the audio playback
5. WHEN the Audio File playback completes naturally, THE AudioDisc System SHALL stop the audio stream and eject the disc

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an addon developer, I want an API to intercept audio playback events, so that I can create extensions that modify or enhance the audio experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE AudioDisc System SHALL provide a public API interface for registering audio playback listeners
2. WHEN a custom Music Disc begins playing, THE AudioDisc System SHALL invoke all registered listeners with playback start event data
3. WHEN a custom Music Disc stops playing, THE AudioDisc System SHALL invoke all registered listeners with playback stop event data
4. THE AudioDisc System SHALL provide API methods to access the Audio File metadata (title, duration, format)
5. THE AudioDisc System SHALL allow registered listeners to modify audio stream properties before playback begins

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a server administrator, I want the system to handle errors gracefully, so that invalid URLs or unsupported files don't crash the server or create a poor user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. IF the provided URL is unreachable or returns an error, THEN THE AudioDisc System SHALL display a descriptive error message to the Player
2. IF the downloaded file exceeds the maximum allowed size, THEN THE AudioDisc System SHALL cancel the download and notify the Player
3. IF the Audio File format is not supported, THEN THE AudioDisc System SHALL display a list of supported formats to the Player
4. WHEN any error occurs during the upload process, THE AudioDisc System SHALL log the error details for administrator review
5. THE AudioDisc System SHALL enforce a timeout of 30 seconds for Audio File downloads
6. THE AudioDisc System SHALL accept Audio Files with content types including audio/*, application/octet-stream, application/ogg, and application/binary

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a player, I want to see visual feedback during the upload process, so that I know the system is working and how long I need to wait.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Player initiates an audio upload, THE AudioDisc System SHALL display a message indicating the download has started
2. WHILE the Audio File is downloading, THE AudioDisc System SHALL display progress updates every 25 percent of completion
3. WHEN the download completes, THE AudioDisc System SHALL display the total download time and file size
4. IF the download takes longer than 5 seconds, THEN THE AudioDisc System SHALL display an estimated time remaining
5. WHEN processing the Audio File, THE AudioDisc System SHALL display a processing status message

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a server administrator, I want custom audio data to persist across server restarts, so that players don't lose their uploaded music.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a custom Music Disc is created, THE AudioDisc System SHALL store the Audio File data in persistent server storage
2. WHEN the server restarts, THE AudioDisc System SHALL load all stored Audio File associations into memory
3. THE AudioDisc System SHALL associate Audio File data with Music Disc items using persistent unique identifiers
4. WHEN a custom Music Disc is dropped or transferred, THE AudioDisc System SHALL maintain the audio association with the item
5. THE AudioDisc System SHALL provide a command to clear stored audio data for maintenance purposes

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a player, I want to see the audio file name displayed on my custom music disc, so that I can easily identify which audio is on each disc.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a custom Music Disc is created, THE AudioDisc System SHALL display the audio file name in the item tooltip
2. WHEN a Player hovers over a custom Music Disc, THE AudioDisc System SHALL display the audio metadata including title and duration
3. THE AudioDisc System SHALL format the duration display as minutes and seconds (MM:SS)
4. THE AudioDisc System SHALL display the uploader's name in the tooltip
5. THE AudioDisc System SHALL visually distinguish custom audio discs from regular music discs in the tooltip

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a player, I want to change the description of my custom music disc, so that I can give it a custom name that's more meaningful than the file name.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE AudioDisc System SHALL provide a `/audiodisc rename <custom_title>` command for Players
2. WHEN a Player executes the rename command while holding a custom Music Disc, THE AudioDisc System SHALL update the disc's custom title
3. IF the Player does not hold a custom Music Disc as their Held Item, THEN THE AudioDisc System SHALL display an error message
4. WHEN the rename is successful, THE AudioDisc System SHALL display a confirmation message to the Player
5. WHEN a Player hovers over a renamed Music Disc, THE AudioDisc System SHALL display the custom title instead of the original file name
